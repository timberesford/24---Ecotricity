# Demand vs Wind & Solar Generation Dashboard


## Description

This is a very basic dashboard, plotting the day ahead forecast for grid demand & solar/wind generation from the elexon API onto one easy to visualise graph.

The entire dashboard consists of two plots, one for today's forecast and one for tomorrow's. The data for tomorrow's forecast can be published anytime up to 6pm Brussel's time the day before so may not be available at the time of viewing.

The intended use is to allow the author to begin exploring energy demand/supply APIs.
